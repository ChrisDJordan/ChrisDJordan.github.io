<h3>About</h3>
<p>This project was my final project for the iron yard. It was redesign of quest atx a cable wakeboard park located in austin tx. While it was a school project I took it as serious as the real thing. Quest atx was the first wakeboard park in Austin and had a lot of hype in the beginning. With a shift in management and a new direction they need  an update their site to invite more new comers to the sport and give clear information to the experienced alike. </p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>

I started with user experiences, being a wakeboarder myself made finding people in the sport fairly easy. I talked to the owners, people who knew nothing about cable parks, first timers, and experience riders. It so soon apparent that the site was overwhelming to new riders and didn't provide users with an understanding of what a cable park is. I also found  that tablet users lost all navigation when using the website. While the content was all there I decided it would need an easy to use layout that allowed the user to find info quickly. I moved into doing a wordlist, swot analysis, and competitive market study to gain all the knowledge I could before starting my design.</p>

<p class="para-padding">I designed five style tiles and narrowed it down to two. After critiques from the class and users I decided to transform a few of the concepts into one. </p>
