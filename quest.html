                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>This project was my final project for The Iron Yard. It was
                a redesign of Quest ATX, a cable wakeboard park located in
                Austin, TX. Quest ATX was the first wakeboard park in Austin
                and had a lot of hype in the beginning. With a shift in
                management and a new direction, it was time for a change in
                their website. They needed an update to invite more newcomers
                to the sport and give clear information to the experienced
                alike. Although it was a school project, I talked with the
                owners of Quest and was able to get a solid understanding of
                their needs.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>I started with user experiences, being a wakeboarder myself
                made finding people in the sport fairly easy. I talked to the
                owners, people who knew nothing about cable parks, first
                timers, and experience riders. It soon became apparent that the
                site was overwhelming to new riders and didn't provide users
                with an understanding of what a cable park is. I also found
                that tablet users lost the navigation when using the website.
                While the content was all there I decided it would need an easy
                to use layout that allowed the user to find info quickly. I
                moved into doing a word list, S.W.O.T analysis, and competitive
                market study to gain all the knowledge I could before starting
                my design.</p>
                <p class="padding">After gaining as much information with the
                research I did, I designed five style tiles with different
                concepts and narrowed it down to two. After critiques from the
                class, I decided to merge the two concepts into one.</p>
                <div class="col-sm-12 padding"><img alt="questatx-styletile"
                src="/images/quest-styletile.png"></div>
                <p>From style tiles, I moved into the sketching phase to figure
                out what the best possible layout would work for the content. I
                decided on one page for all the most important content and
                allow people to learn more by going to the specific page. I
                narrowed it down to two sketches and went into Photoshop to
                make the final decision.</p>
                <p class="padding">Once I had the two layouts and the basic
                look and feel, I could see that it was missing something. I
                brainstormed different ideas to give the layout more
                personality and came up with an angular layout. Wakeboarding is
                very angular be it a ramp, the board itself, or just edging on
                the water.</p>
