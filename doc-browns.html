                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>This project was for Doc Browns in San Antonio. It was the
                second business the family was opening with a different
                atmosphere than the first. They wanted a clean, up to date
                website where they would be able to showcase their food as well
                as have a section for the chef to put press items and blog
                post. Because of the short time frame until the restaurants
                grand opening I had to make fast decisions and create concepts
                quickly. I worked with front-ender Zack Chaney to breakup some
                of the work load while working on other projects. We used
                Sqaurespace's CMS for ease of use and the clients prior
                knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>With a logo, storyboard and competitors in the area I
                started with very little direction. Aiming to meet the client's
                time frame and must haves, my concepts were clean, light and
                elegant. With the time crunch at hand I focused on the main
                Typographical points and color palettes. I used the menu, and
                the navigation in my style tile to show possible layouts.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6"><img alt="docbrowns-styletile2" src=
                "/images/doc-styletile2-2.jpg"></div>
                <p>The client felt that the third style tile was the right
                direction for the website, and we moved on to layout.</p>
