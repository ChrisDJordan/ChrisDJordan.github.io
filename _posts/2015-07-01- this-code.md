##What is this code?  

There are many things in life that are
challenging, and The Iron Yard is definitely one on the top of my list.


The past two weeks we dived into HTML, CSS, and the Terminal.
It's been a super exciting/anxiety driven blast, one that I wouldn't take back.
Each and every day I find myself wondering "can I do this"? while picking
myself up with each line of code.
I couldn't ask for better support from class mates, and a teacher
who really loves what she does. You can just feel the positive vibes
from the everyone here. While each morning until every evening is a
rollercoaster, I know I made the right decision and I couldn't be any happier.

I'm coding
And this is crazy
Here's my Codepen
GitHub me maybe
