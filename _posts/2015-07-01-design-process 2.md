This week we worked on giving and receiving critiques, and I learned a lot. Being a designer isn't about making things look pretty, it's about using a content first approach with design to guide users through experiences that are aesthetically pleasing. As we critiqued each other, we worked hard at removing the word "I" from our vocabulary when giving suggestions (It's not as easy as it sounds!). We also looked at every design from a users perspective, to figure out what was truly needed and what was just fluff that was only getting in the way of the users next steps.    


What may sound like good idea in your head or on paper isn't always the best solution, you have to be willing to allow critiques guide you in the process to creating the best solution. I perused as my class moved through the each website experience, and started to see common trends.    


There is so much that goes into a website that being sporadic isn't going to draw users in, and definitely isn't going to meet deadlines. I think Designers are a bit crazy, and need to be, they take chances, break the mold, and push the industry forward. Finding the perfect balance is key to producing great work.
