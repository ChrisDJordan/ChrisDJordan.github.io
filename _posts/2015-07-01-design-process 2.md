This week we worked on giving and receiving critiques, and I learned a lot more than I thought. Being a Designer isn’t all about making things look pretty, it’s about using content with design to guide users through experiences that are aesthetically pleasing. As we critiqued each other, we worked hard at removing the word “I” from our vocabulary when giving suggestions (It’s not as easy as it sounds!). We also looked at every design from a user’s perspective to figure out what was truly needed. We found that some design decisions were confusing, and only getting in the way of the users next steps.

What may sound like a good idea in your head, isn’t always the best solution. It’s only when you allow critiques to guide your process you find the best  solution. As each student summerized their design choices, I perused through each website and started to see common trends.
I found that we tend to be inconsistent, fail to use enough white space, and
lack readability & legibility in our designs.

There is so much that goes into a website that being sporadic isn’t going to draw users in, and definitely isn’t going to meet deadlines. As Designers we wanna take chances, break the mold, and push the industry forward. Finding the perfect balance between being innovative and using key principles are the foundation to producing great work.
