Sass brings a warm fuzzy happiness to my heart, one which I didn't see coming. I enjoy using CSS, but it's lacking fluidity to its brother html.While I'm still working on a full understanding of Sass,  I can't help but wonder why CSS wasn't doing this from the beginning. While there is still so much to learn I can't help but thank Hampton Catlin for making my life easier. We're in a day and age where things should be simpler. I thank those that dealt with the crazy, and have contributed to fixing the issues.
