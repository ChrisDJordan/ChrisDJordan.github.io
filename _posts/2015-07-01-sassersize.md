Sass brings a warm fuzzy feeling to my heart, one which I didn’t see coming. I enjoy using CSS, but it’s lacking fluidity to its brother HTML. While I’m still working on a full understanding of Sass, I can’t help but wonder why CSS wasn’t doing this from the beginning.  There is still so much to learn, and it’s very exciting. I have to give a big thank you to Hampton Catlin for making my life easier. We’re in a day and age where things should be simpler. I thank those who have improved our workflow and have contributed to fixing the issues.
