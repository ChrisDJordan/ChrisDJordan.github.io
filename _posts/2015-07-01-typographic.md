Today we were tasked with five different typographical concepts for our restaurant project. It seemed like an easy task, but was definitely more challenging than I thought. Good design  doesnâ€™t come easy. I spent an hour in Bouldin Creek Cafe, getting a feel for the environment, and with the help of a good friend, I manage to get some good photos aswell. I looked at menus to pull ideas for typefaces and tried to translate their message. I went with Tablet Gothic Compressed for the headers and Fira Sans 2 for the body copy. I felt that those typefaces had a clean organic feel, without being too overdone.
