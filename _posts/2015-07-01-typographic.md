Today we were tasked with five different typographical concepts for our restaurant project. It of course seemed like an easy task, But was definitely more challenging than I thought. Good design does doesn't come easy. I spent an hour in Bouldin Creek Cafe, getting a feel for environment, and with the help of a good friend, I manage to get some good photos of the restaurant. I looked at menus to pull ideas for typefaces, and tried to translate their message. I went with Tablet Gothic Compressed for the headers and Fira Sans 2 for the body copy. I felt that those typefaces had a clean organic feel, without being to overdone.
